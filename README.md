# Skript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SkriptLang/Skript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SkriptLang/Skript)
Skript is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people
to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you
*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used
for prototyping etc.

This Github fork of Skript is based on Mirreski's improvements which was built
on Njol's original Skript.

## Supported Versions
Skript requires **Spigot** to work. You heard it right, Bukkit does *not* work.
**Paper**, which is a fork of Spigot, is recommended; it is required for some
parts of Skript to be available.

Skript supports **latest releases** of Minecraft 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.
For example, this means that 1.12.2 is supported, but 1.12.1 is *not*.
Testing with all minor Minecraft releases is not feasible for us.

Minecraft 1.8 and earlier are not, and will not be supported. New Minecraft
versions will be supported as soon as possible.

## Documentation
Documentation is available [here](https://skriptlang.github.io/Skript/) for the
latest version of Skript.

## Reporting Issues
Please see our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before reporting issues.

## A Note About Addons
We don't support addons here, even though some of Skript developers have also
developed their own addons.

## Compiling
Skript uses Gradle for compilation. Use your command prompt of preference and
navigate to Skript's source directory. Then you can just call Gradle to compile
and package Skript for you:

```bash
./gradlew clean build # on UNIX-based systems (mac, linux)
gradlew clean build # on Windows
```

You can get source code from the [releases](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases) page.
You may also clone this repository, but that code may or may not be stable.

### Compiling Modules
Parts of Skript are provided as Gradle subprojects. They require Skript, so
they are compiled *after* it has been built. For this reason, if you want them
embedded in Skript jar, you must re-package it after compiling once. For example:

```
./gradlew jar
```

Note that modules are not necessary for Skript to work. Currently, they are
only used to provide compatibility with old WorldGuard versions.

### Importing to Eclipse
With new Eclipse versions, there is integrated Gradle support, and it actually works now.
So, first get latest Eclipse, then import Skript as any Gradle project. Just
make sure to **keep** the configuration when the importer asks for that!

If you encounter strange issues, make sure you follow the instructions above and have
actually downloaded latest Eclipse or update your installation correctly. Skript's
new Gradle version (starting from dev26) does not work very well with older Eclipse
versions. Also, do *not* use Gradle STS; it is outdated.

### Importing to IDEA
You'll need to make sure that nullness annotations are working correctly. Also,
when sending pull requests, make sure not to change IDEA configuration files
that may have been stored in the repository.

## Contributing
Please review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
In addition to that, if you are contributing Java code, check our
[coding conventions](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/CODING_CONVENTIONS.md).

## Maven repository
If you use Skript as (soft) dependency for your plugin, and use maven or Gradle,
this is for you.

First, you need to add the JitPack repository at the **END** of all your repositories. Skript is not available in Maven Central.
```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
    ...
    maven {
        url 'https://jitpack.io'
    }
}
```

Or, if you use Maven:
```maven
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

For versions of Skript after dev37 you might need to add the paper-api repository to prevent build issues.

```gradle
maven {
    url 'https://repo.destroystokyo.com/repository/maven-public/'
}
```

Or, if you use Maven:
```maven
<repository>
    <id>destroystokyo-repo</id>
    <url>https://repo.destroystokyo.com/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
</repository>
```

Then you will also need to add Skript as a dependency.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.SkriptLang:Skript:[versionTag]'
}
```

An example of the version tag would be ```dev37c```.

> Note: If Gradle isn't able to resolve Skript's dependencies, just [disable the resolution of transitive dependencies](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/managing_transitive_dependencies.html#sub:disabling_resolution_transitive_dependencies) for Skript in your project.

Or, if you use Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.SkriptLang</groupId>
    <artifactId>Skript</artifactId>
    <version>[versionTag]</version>
</dependency>
```
