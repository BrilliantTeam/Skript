  Skript is a (surprise, surprise) a scripting plugin for Bukkit platform. It
  is easy to use for simple tasks, but yet you can create really complex things
  with it. The syntax of Skript is close to English, but it is still not magic.
  While for simple tasks you might succeed with experimentation, for anything
  more complex you will need some guidance.

<p>
  This is Skript documentation. You will find all supported features of Skript
  plugin here. You might also find some useful examples, in case you need more
  than what was shipped with Skript distribution. We do not currently have
  tutorial here, but you can find good ones using (whatever) search engine you prefer.

  <strong>Looking for docs authors!</strong>
  Currently, the only documentation is generated automatically. It would be
  nice to have some tutorials etc. here. For example, currently we don't have
  a tutorial on how to use loops here; makes it harder for newcomers to learn.
  Check <a href="https://github.com/bensku/Skript/issues/611">this issue</a> for
  details and discussion about topic.
